        Concerned about the potential negative impact of the proposed Bill 94 in
        Quebec, over 50 Muslim women from KW came together to organize a
        community forum titled “Let Us Talk” at Kitchener City Hall on April 26,
        2010. Attended by over 150 community members and the local media, the
        forum was a proactive opportunity for Muslim women to add their voices
        to the public discourse about them, while diminishing many
        misconceptions. Following the success of this event, the group decided
        to continue their association and form an organization, “The Coalition
        of Muslim Women of KW” with the aim to build bridges of understanding
        with the larger community and to strengthen the voices of Muslim women
        in this area. Now, CMW is a federally incorporated not-for-profit
        organization with a large body of diverse and dedicated members and
        volunteers, offering high quality events and programs working in
        partnership with numerous not for profit organizations and community
        groups in Waterloo Region. CMW’s membership and volunteer opportunities
        are open to all women who are in agreement with organization’s vision,
        mission, values and code of conduct regardless of their religious or
        non-religious affiliation"
