        Despite prosperity in our society, hunger is a reality for many of our
        neighbours. Food banks across Canada receive hundreds of thousands of
        visits each month, and more than one third of food bank clients are
        children.

        Give30 is a nation-wide Ramadan initiative in which everyone is
        requested to give $30 during Ramadan. The ask is to save the money one
        would have spent on coffee, tea, lattes, donuts, or other treats and
        donate it to Give30 instead. It might be a small change for 30 days, but
        it can make a difference for those who donâ€™t have enough to eat.
